      <Statement>&lt;p&gt;Mathematically proficient students make sense of quantities and their relationships in problem situations. They bring two complementary abilities to bear on problems involving quantitative relationships: the ability to &lt;i&gt;decontextualize&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;to abstract a given situation and represent it symbolically and manipulate the representing symbols as if they have a life of their own, without necessarily attending to their referents&amp;mdash;and the ability to &lt;i&gt;contextualize&lt;/i&gt;, to pause as needed during the manipulation process in order to probe into the referents for the symbols involved. Quantitative reasoning entails habits of creating a coherent representation of the problem at hand; considering the units involved; attending to the meaning of quantities, not just how to compute them; and knowing and flexibly using different properties of operations and objects.&lt;/p&gt;
